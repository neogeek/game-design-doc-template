## Summary

Here is a quick summary of the game, usually starting with a one-line pitch sentence. This sentence needs to quickly describe enough of the game concept, whether that's through comparisons or describing a core mechanic, that a person can understand what you are going to build.

Example: Very similar to Tetris but instead of pieces falling, they ascend.

## Core Mechanics

Here you organize core mechanics into sections. In each section describe in exhaustive detail how each mechanic works. Even the most simple concept to you might not be as apparent to someone else. No detail is too mundane.

A few example sections are listed below.

### Movement

### Shooting

### Reloading

## Game Features

Here you organize feature of the game into sections. In each section, describe what you would see and do with each feature. This could be something related to gameplay, settings, credits, etc.

A few example sections are listed below.

### Title Screen

### Options

### Achivements

### Analytics

### Credits

Remember, this document is meant to be law when building your game. If something changes with how your game is designed, it's a good idea to revisit this document and update the relevant sections. Doing so might expose an issue you didn't otherwise think of previously.

If you have screenshots of existing designs or concepts, this document is a great place to keep them.

This is a living document. If you, through your experience writing these documents, have suggestions or comments, please submit an issue or fork this repo and submit a pull request. My experience in the game development world is limited, but I hope to use this document to improve my process working alone and with other people.
